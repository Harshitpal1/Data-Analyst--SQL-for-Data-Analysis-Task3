# Data Analyst Internship - Task 4: Dashboard Design

[cite_start]This repository contains the solution for the Data Analyst Internship task provided by Elevate Labs[cite: 1, 2].

***

## üìù Objective

[cite_start]The primary goal of this task is to design an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders[cite: 4]. [cite_start]The intended outcome is to learn how to create dashboards that effectively inform business decisions[cite: 16].

***

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Dataset

* [cite_start]**Tools**: The recommended tools for this task are **Power BI** or **Tableau**[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Dataset**: The task requires using any **Sales/Financial dataset** available on Kaggle[cite: 15].

***

## üìä Dashboard Design Guide

The dashboard was created following these key guidelines to ensure it is insightful and user-friendly:

* [cite_start]**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: The dashboard prominently features important KPIs such as **Sales, Profit, and Growth** to provide a quick overview of business performance[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Interactivity**: **Slicers and filters** are used to allow stakeholders to explore and analyze the data dynamically[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Trend Analysis**: A **time-series analysis** is included to visualize trends and patterns over different periods[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]**Summary Cards**: The dashboard includes **cards for totals and summaries** to highlight the most critical figures at a glance[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Visual Consistency**: A **consistent color theme** is applied throughout the dashboard for a clean, professional, and easy-to-understand visual experience[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Navigation**: Where applicable, a **navigation menu** has been created to improve usability, allowing users to easily switch between different views or pages of the report[cite: 13].

## ‚ùì Interview Questions & Answers

[cite_start]Here are the answers to the interview questions listed in the task description[cite: 18, 19].

### What are the key elements of a dashboard?

The key elements of a well-designed dashboard are:
* **Clear Visualizations**: Using charts and graphs that are easy to understand.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Highlighting the most important metrics.
* **Interactivity**: Incorporating filters and slicers for data exploration.
* **Logical Layout**: A clean and organized design.
* **Time-Series Analysis**: Showing trends over time.

### What is a KPI?

[cite_start]A **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)** is a measurable value that shows how effectively a company is achieving its main business objectives[cite: 20]. Organizations use KPIs to evaluate their success at reaching targets. For instance, in sales, a KPI could be 'Monthly Sales Growth' or 'Average Profit Margin'.

### What are slicers in Power BI?

[cite_start]**Slicers** in Power BI are a type of on-canvas visual filter[cite: 21]. They provide a user-friendly way for anyone viewing the report to filter the data. For example, a user can click on a specific year in a slicer to see all the visuals on the page update to reflect the data for only that year.

### Difference between Power BI and Tableau?

| Feature | Power BI | Tableau |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ease of Use** | Generally considered more user-friendly for beginners and integrates well with other Microsoft products. | Has a steeper learning curve but offers greater flexibility in creating custom and complex visualizations. |
| **Cost** | More cost-effective, offering a robust free desktop version. | Generally has a higher licensing cost. |
| **Data Connectivity**| Excellent connectivity, especially within the Microsoft ecosystem (Azure, SQL Server, Excel). | Also offers extensive data connectivity options and is praised for its performance with large datasets. |
| **Data Modeling** | Features a powerful data modeling engine (Power Query) integrated into the tool. | Data preparation often relies on Tableau Prep, a separate product. |

### How do you make a dashboard interactive?

[cite_start]You can make a dashboard interactive by[cite: 23]:
* **Adding Slicers and Filters**: This allows users to segment the data.
* **Enabling Drill-Down**: Letting users click on a part of a visual to see more detailed data.
* **Using Cross-Filtering**: When a user clicks on a data point in one visual, other visuals on the page are automatically filtered.
* **Implementing Bookmarks and Buttons**: This creates a custom navigation experience.

### How do you deal with large datasets in dashboards?

[cite_start]To handle large datasets efficiently[cite: 24]:
* **Optimize the Data Model**: Use a star schema and reduce the number of columns to only what is necessary.
* **Use Aggregations**: Create summary tables to reduce the number of rows that need to be processed.
* **Choose the Right Storage Mode**: Use **DirectQuery** or a **Live Connection** in Power BI/Tableau. This mode queries the data source directly instead of importing the entire dataset.
* **Filter Data at the Source**: Apply filters when connecting to the data source to only bring in the relevant information.

### What chart types do you use for trend analysis?

[cite_start]For trend analysis, the most effective chart types are[cite: 25]:
* **Line Charts**: Ideal for showing trends over a continuous period. 
* **Area Charts**: Similar to line charts, but they emphasize the volume or magnitude of the trend over time.
* **Column Charts**: Useful for comparing values across discrete time periods.
